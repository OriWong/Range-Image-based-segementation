# Range-Image-based-segementation
An implementation on "I. Bogoslavskyi and C. Stachniss, "Fast range image-based segmentation of sparse 3D laser scans for online operation," 2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Daejeon, 2016, pp. 163-169, doi: 10.1109/IROS.2016.7759050."

An official implementaiton is here:https://github.com/PRBonn/depth_clustering 

### Different from paper:

    1. We changed the ground segmentation method
    2. Using hash map replace the image-based search

### The Result
